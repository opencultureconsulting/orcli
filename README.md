# orcli (ðŸ’Ž+ðŸ¤–)

Bash script to control OpenRefine via [its HTTP API](https://docs.openrefine.org/technical-reference/openrefine-api).

## Features

* works with latest OpenRefine version (currently 3.5)
* nested sub-commands with help screens and usage examples
* batch processing (import, transform, export) with temporary workspaces; your existing OpenRefine data will not be touched
* import CSV~~, TSV, line-based TXT, fixed-width TXT, JSON or XML~~ (and specify input options)
* transform data by providing an [undo/redo](https://docs.openrefine.org/manual/running#history-undoredo) JSON file; orcli calls specific endpoints for each operation to provide improved error handling and logging
* export to ~~CSV,~~ TSV~~, HTML, XLS, XLSX, ODS~~
* ~~[templating export](https://docs.openrefine.org/manual/exporting#templating-exporter) to additional formats like JSON or XML~~

## Requirements

* GNU/Linux with Bash
* [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)
* [curl](https://curl.se/)
